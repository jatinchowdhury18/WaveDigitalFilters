# Wave Digital Filters

TODO:

- migrate WDFPrototyper
- set up GitHub Actions
- work on WDF unit tests

This repository contains code for real-time implementations of virtual analog circuit models using wave digital filters.

**NOTE: The WDF library in this repository is now maintained as a part of the
[chowdsp_utils](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/chowdsp_utils) JUCE module. This repository now serves as a reference
of how to implement some example circuits using the WDF code.**

## Organization

`shared/` contains general WDF code, that can be used by any circuit model. Each other folder contains a single circuit
model implemented as an audio plugin using JUCE/C++.

## Background

Wave digital filters (WDFs) are a unique and exciting
circuit modelling technique that allows the model to be
broken down into individual components and connections.
See the resources below for more information.

The code in this repository belongs to Jatin Chowdhury, except the
implementation of the Wright-Omega function approximations (`shared/omega.h`)
which belongs to Stefano D'Angelo. More licensing details are
still being worked out.
