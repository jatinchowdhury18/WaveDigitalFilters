# Bucket Brigade Device

Bucket Bridgae Devices (BBDs) are a type of analog delay circuit common in some
guitar pedals and synthesizers. The basic idea is to have a bunch of capacitors
connected by alternating switches, so that as the switches are toggled on and off, the
input voltage is passed down the line of capacitors, like a "bucket brigade".

The WDF model implemented here is not a particularly practical BBD emulation, but it is a pretty
cool example of how far we can go with WDF circuit modelling.
